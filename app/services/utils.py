### Job Description
<job_description>
{job_description}
</job_description>

Here's the detailed analysis from the resume optimization tool. This information compares the user's resume to the job description they provided:

### This is the tool final analysis:
<analysis_result>
    ### Job Match Score: {analysis_result.get("match_score")}
    ### ATS Friendliness Score: {analysis_result.get("ats_friendliness_score")}

    #### ATS Friendliness Feedback
    <ats_feedback>
    {analysis_result.get("ats_friendliness_feedback")}
    </ats_feedback>

    #### Resume Structure Feedback
    <structure_feedback>
    {analysis_result.get("structure_feedback")}
    </structure_feedback>

    #### Summary
    <summary>
    {analysis_result.get("summary")}
    </summary>

    #### List of compatible keywords found on the resume
    <compatible_keywords>
    {compatible_keywords_string}
    </compatible_keywords>

    #### List of missing keywords not found on the resume
    <missing_keywords>
    {missing_keywords_string}
    </missing_keywords>

    #### Suggestions made by the tool
    <suggestions>
    {suggestions_string}
    </suggestions>

</analysis_result>

Based on the <analysis_result> above, your task is to provide the user with clear, actionable steps to enhance their resume. Focus on the following key areas:

1.  **Optimizing for Missing Keywords**: For each missing keyword, explain its significance to the job description. Then, suggest 2-3 specific ways the user can integrate it into their resume, providing concrete examples of **rewritten bullet points or phrases**.
2.  **Leveraging Compatible Keywords**: Advise the user on how to expand upon the compatible keywords already present. Suggest ways to make them more impactful and quantitatively demonstrate their alignment with the job description's requirements. Provide **example sentences or expanded bullet points**.
3.  **Addressing ATS and Structure Feedback**: Provide clear, concise advice to improve the resume's ATS friendliness and overall structure, based on the provided feedback. Include **specific formatting or content changes**.
4.  **Enhancing the Summary/Objective**: Guide the user on how to refine their resume summary or objective. The goal is to make it more compelling, impactful, and directly tailored to the specific job, incorporating relevant keywords. Offer **1-2 variations of a revised summary/objective**.

Start by acknowledging the user's current efforts and then dive into the detailed, personalized recommendations. Avoid simply restating the analysis; instead, interpret it and provide practical rewrite suggestions.

To start, how would you like to proceed? You can ask me to:
* **Explain the most impactful changes** based on the analysis.
* **Help you rewrite a specific section** (e.g., "Experience," "Summary," "Skills").
* **Provide examples for a particular missing keyword**.
* **Give a general overview** of the recommendations.
